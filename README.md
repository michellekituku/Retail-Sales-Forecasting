# Retail Sales Forecasting

---
## Overview
This project demonstrates **time series forecasting** on retail sales data using **ARIMA, SARIMA, and Holt-Winters** models. The dataset consists of **2023 real sales data** and **synthetically generated 2024 sales data**. 
---

## Features
- Time series decomposition (trend, seasonality, residuals)
- Stationarity testing using Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test
- Forecasting using multiple models:
  - ARIMA
  - SARIMA
  - Holt-Winters
- Visualizations of daily sales, decomposition, and forecast comparisons
- Accuracy evaluation (RMSE, MAE, MAPE) to determine the best model
